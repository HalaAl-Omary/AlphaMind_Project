# AlphaMind: Agentic RAG with MCP & Ollama
### Local Agentic AI Financial Analysis Platform
---

## 🧠 Project Description
**AlphaMind Pro** is an Agentic AI application designed to perform intelligent financial analysis using a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM).
The system combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **CrewAI agents** and exposes its capabilities through an **MCP Server**, providing structured and context-aware financial insights.

The application allows users to analyze stock market data and receive professional summaries and recommendations through a Streamlit-based user interface.
